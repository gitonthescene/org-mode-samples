* OrgMode sample snippets!
** Why bother?
   The intention of this repository is to build up copius examples of org-mode snippets to be used
   for testing parsers of the grammar.  Ideally, this would be a place for developers and users to
   share samples to demonstrate issues with whatever is being developed.  As the collection grows,
   so would the set of examples available for testing hopefully improving the quality of tools built
   on top of org-mode.

   I can envision a user using the collection to try to narrow down a buggy case and/or point a
   developer at an example to demonstrate an issue.  Or, absent an existing case, creating one.
   
** Okay ... but how is it organized?
   At the moment it isn't very well organized. :^) Since this is envisioned to be a community
   effort, the hope is that the community will have the best ideas for how it should be organized.
   But I have a couple ideas.

   For instance, the current [[https://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-syntax.html][spec]] for the org-mode grammar isn't terribly precise at points.  There
   appear to be things like skipping a heading level which is tolerated by the ~org-element.el~
   parser, but seemingly not allowed according to the spec.  I can imagine having a section of the
   tests for /pathalogical cases/.  I can also imagine a section specifically for say blocks.
   
** Um .. if it's not organized, then once again, why bother?
   You have to start somewhere!  :^)  I've tried to get the ball rolling and will add what I can
   think up, but for this to really be successful it's going to need community input.

   Let's make this happen!

** What's here so far?
   My first stab at this is to have a single file with multiple snippets in it to make editing
   easier.  Each snippet is separated by a null character (~^@~ in emacs).  I then used the
   following zsh to split that up into separate files in a folder of the same name.

   : $ c=0
   : $ cat headings.org | while read  -d '' f; do printf "$f" > headings/$c.org; c=$((c+1)); done

   If this proves a useful approach I'll look to automate this.

** I guess this could be useful ...
   Awesome!!  Welcome aboard!!!

   See Wiki for brainstorming ideas.

* SOMETHING USEFUL!! (??)
  Under ~/scripts~, there is a simple elisp script which can be run in batch mode to print the
  structure of an org document as emacs sees it.  It can be run as follows:

  : $ emacs --batch v0.0/headings/12.org --eval="(require 'package)" --eval="(package-initialize)" --eval="(require 'dash)" -l $(pwd)/scripts/dumptree.el
  : (org-data
  :  (section
  :   (paragraph))
  :  (headline
  :   (section
  :    (paragraph))
  :   (headline
  :    (section
  :     (paragraph)))))
  : $

  With a little more scripting foo, you can run it on a bunch of files:

    : $ seq 8 12 | while read num; do echo "== $num =="; emacs --batch v0.0/headings/$num.org --eval="(require 'package)" --eval="(package-initialize)" --eval="(require 'dash)" -l $(pwd)/scripts/dumptree.el; done
    : == 8 ==
    : (org-data
    :  (headline
    :   (section
    :    (paragraph))
    :   (headline)))
    : == 9 ==
    : (org-data
    :  (section
    :   (paragraph))
    :  (headline
    :   (section
    :    (paragraph))
    :   (headline)))
    : == 10 ==
    : (org-data
    :  (headline
    :   (headline
    :    (section
    :     (paragraph)))))
    : == 11 ==
    : (org-data
    :  (headline
    :   (headline
    :    (section
    :     (paragraph)))))
    : == 12 ==
    : (org-data
    :  (section
    :   (paragraph))
    :  (headline
    :   (section
    :    (paragraph))
    :   (headline
    :    (section
    :     (paragraph)))))
    : $
